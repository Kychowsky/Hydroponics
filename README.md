This is my attempt at creating a near-fully automated greenhouse.

Features:
  Sensing:
    Temperature
    Total Dissolved Solids(EC)
    Water Level
    PH Level

  Automated Tasks:
    Water Pumping
    Nutrient Dosing
    PH Up/Down Dosing(potentially)
    Lighting Schedule based of Growth Stage

  A interactive Web Page to allow for manual input
  Data Retrieval via WIFI/MQTT for analysis

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Hope to add Machine Learning for Growth Optimization
